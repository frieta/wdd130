        <p>Hello, my name is Ferdinan Lim Rieta. I enjoy watching the One Piece anime, playing table tennis and badminton,<br> as well as playing console and PC games. I have a passion for learning and acquiring new knowledge.<br>If you ever need someone to talk to or simply want someone to listen to everything you have to say,<br> feel free to reach out to me. I won't judge you and I'll do my best to motivate and encourage you in whatever you <br>want to achieve or do, as long as it is beneficial for you and doesn't harm anyone along your journey.</p>
